# Duck-DNA-fingerprinting-identification-tool

The duck DNA fingerprinting identification tool was used for efficient identification of duck genetic resources. The input file format is a vcf file, including a single individual or a merged vcf file of multiple individuals. The duck genome version refers to CAU_wild 1.0(https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-113/fasta/anas_platyrhynchos/dna/Anas_platyrhynchos.ASM874695v1.dna.nonchromosomal.fa.gz). This repository contains the program to run the duck DNA fingerprinting identification tool as well as a small sample data file and example results.

If you use the duck DNA fingerprinting identification tool in published research, please cite.
